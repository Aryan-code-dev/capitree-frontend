 ## TODO:

1. Make default node on register
2. Manage sending update request only if backend has loaded
3. Make default return type for node
4. Insert new nodes where cursor is present right now
5. Add return object to node
6. Make the add node functionality from code. (Just copy paste the api and the corresponding node will be created)
