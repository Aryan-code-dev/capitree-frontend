## Purpose
This is an API collaboration tool built to increase collaboration between frfont end and backend engineers. 
## Working
The nodes represent api endpoint and edges from user node to api end point nodes or intra api end point nodes represent. The unique tree diagram shape of the api endpoint is for better readability.
## Unique features
1. Tree like api diagram
2. Collaborative- Multiple users can work on it at the same time. Concurrency is handled using event passing in web sockets. 

## Following parts of the project are still under development
1. The backend engineer can directly paste the node api code and get the node added in the UI.
2. Return format
